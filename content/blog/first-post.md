So I've finally got a website up and running - now I can focus on writing posts.

I've got a couple things to tackle in the next couple weeks. First, modernizing (i.e. updating to idiomatic Py3 code, while still maintaining Py2 compatibility) a library that I'm leveraging for a torrent client management program I'm developing.

After the library work is done, I can start finishing the related program. Ideally I'd like to make some robust tests. That'll require digging into pytest and learning the proper way to go about testing functionality - I'll probably have to include actual files and data somehow.

That's all for now. Time and stamina permitting I can come back with updates before November!
